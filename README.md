# arithmetic_arranger
Students in primary school often arrange arithmetic problems vertically to make them easier to solve. For example, "235 + 52" becomes:

  235
+  52
-----
The arithmetic_arranger function that receives a list of strings which are arithmetic problems, and returns the problems arranged vertically and side-by-side. The function should optionally take a second argument. When the second argument is set to True, the answers should be displayed.
